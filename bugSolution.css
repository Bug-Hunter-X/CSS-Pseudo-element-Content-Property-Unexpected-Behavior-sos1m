To reliably use `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements, always explicitly define the `content` property. This ensures consistent rendering across different browsers.  Even if you want whitespace, you need to explicitly declare it.

```css
.element::before {
  content: ''; /* Explicitly set to an empty string */
}

.element::after {
  content: " "; /*Explicitly set to a space*/
}
```
By explicitly setting the `content` property, you eliminate the ambiguity and ensure the expected visual outcome.
